Greetings. I have been informed you are the person
to contact to get things done. I am searching for an
ancient relic. I want you to get it for me. But first
I need you to eliminate a captain for me. He is close
to finding it and I will not allow that. I am giving
you a powerful antique weapon to get it done. So get
it done.

AHA! You are just the person I needed it seems. The
twi.. I mean relic is one step closer... BLAST I have
just been notified robot rebels have taken over
all paths to the relic. You'll have to go into their
base and destroy the mothertank. Goodluck.

Goodjob! I'm looking forward to the taste of the 
delicious twinkie... er I mean relic. Fine it is a
twinkie. But it is the last one on earth. Either way
your almost to the factory containing the last
twinkie in the world. The problem is aliens want it
too. If you kill their leader they may return to
the planet they came from. Get to it.

You found it. But I don't have much longer. 
The nazis have come for me... They are looking for me. You must get to
their leader and kill him... Oh the agony. I am
dying soon. No really I am. I am bleeding. There
is one last thing I want to tell you. But it seems
I do not have the strength to continue. Because
I am dying. So I will never be able to tell you
the important information I want you to know.....
..................................................
........ This is awkward... AHHHH..

Notes when using the tilemanager:
- Will always keep all rendering info & collisions
- Won't always keep data like spawners and enemy spawn points

*WARNING* AFTER CALL THESE TWO FUNCTIONS DATA IN THEM IS GONE *WARNING*

How to get enemy spawn points and its type:
	-vector<ENEMY_INFO> GetEnemyInfo(void);

- This will return an ENEMY_INFO struct that is a global struct declared in Layer.h
- Contains X and Y pos and a "type"
- type =  0-2 for which type of enemy it is according to the enum defined in Enemy.h

How to get spawner info
	-vector<ENEMY_INFO> GetSpawnInfo(void);

- This return an ENEMY_INFO struct that is a global declared in Layer.h
- Contains X and Y pos and a "type"
- type = 1-3 , subtract one and will be the same as the enum define in Enemy.h

How to make,start, and delete:

1.)m_pTileM = CTileManager::GetInstance();
